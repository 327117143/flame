# examples folder

This folder contains a collection of more specific examples using flame, specially to showcase some more advanced functionality.

To run this examples after cloning, first run `flutter create .` inside to generate the necessary files, as per instructed by the other flutter commands.

After that, you should be able to `flutter run` just fine.

In order to simplify the understanding of each examples, they are all missing the following folders:

```
android, ios, web, macos, test
```

So that we can focus on the `lib` and (if applicable) `assets` folder. Please add that to the gitignore of your new example.
